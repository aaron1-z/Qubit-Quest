1. Show dual-world view (two mirrored avatars).
2. Explain entanglement: moving one avatar moves the mirrored.
3. Highlight quantum walk tiles: probabilistic superposition.
4. Press SPACE: Hadamard gate → tile amplitudes change (flickering visual).
5. Collapse row: success/failure based on coherence.
6. Move to next row: demonstrate cascading quantum effect.
7. End demo with fully coherent exit → explain Entanglement Coherence Algorithm.
